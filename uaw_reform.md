title: Reforming Our Local
---

__Increasing Elected Leadership:__ Local leadership, including the bargaining committee, should not be a small, exclusive club. It should include all rank-and-file organizers fighting for better working conditions.

__More Frequent Elections:__ Student-workers have high turnover, with some members only serving in a represented position for as little as a few months. Thus, with the current three-year election cycle, significant amounts of the academic workforce, have effectively no voice within our union. For instance, a master’s student may finish their entire degree and graduate without participating in a union election. A more reasonable timeframe for election cycles would be once per academic year, as seen in both graduate and undergraduate student governmental bodies.

__Ranked Choice Voting:__ Elected leadership should be representative of the workers that elected them. “First past the post/winner takes all,” our local’s current electoral system, practically ensures majoritarian rule with those in the majority taking every seat, effectively disenfranchising nearly half the union. We believe in Single Transferable Vote/Ranked Choice Voting, in which the number of representatives is determined by the proportion of the electorate who has voted for them. 

__One Member, One Vote:__ AWDU supports the movement to directly elect UAW International Executive Board (IEB). AWDU will work extensively to support the demands of Unite All Workers for Democracy ([UAWD](https://uawd.org/)) to institute meaningful changes to increase transparency, accountability, and accessibility in the UAW International.

__Officer Pay:__ Organizing takes work; with union officers undergoing long working hours with no pay. This leads union officers, especially those of color and active in other community organizations, to frequently experience burnout and resign from their current positions. The current system allows the Executive Board to appoint a few elected officers as staff, allowing “loyal” officers to be paid and leading to an unequal distribution of resources. AWDU will set clear standards for officer pay, equally distributing resources based on their elected position and duties rather than favoritism. 

__Staff Recallability:__ Paid union staff members should be accountable to the workers they represent. Currently, UAW statewide imposes staff members upon local campuses, with no input from local organizers. This leads to ineffective resource usage, with staff members being out-of-touch with local issues and misaligned with local campus organizers. AWDU will allow campuses to determine their own staff members, with the ability to recall staff members with sufficient turnout at a monthly membership meeting.

__Instantly Recallable:__ Individual bargaining committee members can be instantly recalled through a unit-wide vote if a sufficient number of unit members believe they have violated their commitments to representing the interests of our union.

__Expanding the Unit:__ By increasing our membership, we can win better contracts. We will work to organize all student-workers into our union, including residence hall assistants, peer mentors, and dining commons workers (as done at UMass Amherst), and other non-represented student-worker positions.
