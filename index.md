<div style="text-align: justify">
    Collective action is how we win. We are members of UAW 2865 and Student Researchers United who believe in building the power of our union’s rank and file members. Our vision is one of a union that’s run by an active and involved membership, fighting for our best interests as undergraduate and graduate workers, and that has the courage to hold accountable those who would make decisions for us without us.
