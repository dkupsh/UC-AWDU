### For A Rank-And-File Union

Organized labor functions on the idea that workers can win when they struggle together. A rank and file union is a union that empowers its members — the rank and file — to express the political will and strategy of the union as a whole. 

A rank and file UAW 2865 would give autonomy to its campus chapters and allocate resources for them to self-organize around locally relevant issues, promoting participation in the struggles closest to the lives of student workers. The statewide apparatus would then strive to advance these struggles with its additional personnel, finances, and legal resources. The past year proves that the power of such struggles, like that over housing in Santa Cruz, can catalyze genuine participation across the state. 

A rank and file UAW 2865 cannot have paid staffers serve as elected officers. The strategic missteps of our statewide union last year at least partly flowed from having a small leadership core who also occupy paid staff positions. These individuals will call themselves your “co-workers” while sometimes earning more than three times the average worker’s annual salary. Of course, it is fine that our union employs people and pays them well, but it is obviously wrong to permit these people to make strategic decisions on behalf of all workers. Last spring, paid staffers on our union’s Bargaining Team comprised a full half of the votes against holding a strike authorization vote among the membership, and none of the votes for it. The final vote was 10-8 against: the rank and file were not permitted to vote on launching a legally protected strike.

This situation entrenches a layer of union bureaucrats whose economic conditions are removed from the conditions of the rank and file. This layer tends to function in order to preserve itself, typically by working in the interests of the boss (“we are not strike ready”). And it eventually comes to stand in for the union as a whole, such that “UAW 2865” is identified only with its leadership, to the benefit of the UC and this small cadre of well-paid staffers. 

In a rank and file union, staff input strictly serves members. It helps them articulate what they want and how to get it. Union staff facilitate the development of rank and file engagement at all levels of union activity, promoting the circulation of leadership positions and expertise among an expanding group of organizers. This prevents circumstances like those prevailing in statewide union meetings right now, where a small core of leaders possess all the information and resources, and doggedly fight down proposals that would limit their power — such as the separation of elected decision makers from staff positions. 

The future Rank and File SRU-UAW/UAW 2865 will end this scandal and dissolve its bureaucrat layer. At the local level, it will give campuses financial and strategic autonomy, and allow campus leadership to contact its own members without censorship, a right they recently lost under the present union bureaucracy. At the statewide level, it will introduce ranked choice voting, bring transparency to staff hiring decisions, and solicit genuine input from campuses for statewide meetings. **The recent history of UAW 2865 proves all too plainly that the power of a union comes from its rank and file, or not at all.**

### UC-AWDU’s Economic Demand: Pay Us Enough to Live Here!

Academic student workers teach approximately half of all undergraduate educational hours delivered in the UC, for which we are allotted a mere 2% of the UC operations budget. Recent generations of student workers have endured skyrocketing rents throughout California, in some cases by 15% per year and over 50% across the length of our four-year contract. Rent burden is defined as spending 30% or more of your income on rent. It is typical for many of us to spend over half.

The heavy weight of our academic labor — 50% of all UC instruction hours — means that we occupy a chokepoint position within the university from which we can disrupt its normal business operations and fight for alternative models of education and academic labor. 

We know that real economic gains for academic workers can be won and defended when the rank and file takes direct action. The UC knows this too, which is why real wage increases resulted from our most recent statewide strike in 2014. It is also why the UC promised annual housing stipends to both UCSC and UCLA last year in the context of the wildcats, but only found it possible to take that stipend away from UCLA workers. 

This points to an elemental truth of labor politics: whenever we do not fight to preserve the gains we’ve made, our employer will fight to undermine them. For too long, UAW 2865 has not fought. For too long, UAW 2865’s paid leaders have been content while the material conditions of the rank and file have deteriorated, their wages drawn further and further into the rent check.

The statewide struggle for a Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA) was interrupted by the shock of the pandemic. But it demonstrated that rank and file workers are not willing to wait around until the next contract negotiation to demand a living wage (one that keeps pace with California’s astronomical rent increases) and that such a demand, when coupled with militant action by rank and file workers, can create a compelling political opening in an otherwise stale union. 

Our current contract was rushed through by our union leaders in a summer ratification vote, a quiet capitulation and handshake with the boss. It secured measly inflation-level wage increases, without ever exploring what we might have won by exercising our power to strike. UC-AWDU will never ratify a contract simply for the sake of having a contract.  

While current union leaders continue to pat themselves on the back for winning a $100 campus fee remission, UC-AWDU will fight for a 100% tuition and fee remission for all ASEs, including undergraduate student workers. No worthwhile union would celebrate a situation where thousands of workers pay $300 of their poverty-level salaries to use the internet at work. 

While current union leaders, obsessed with administration over agitation, occupy themselves with the symbolism of gathering strike pledges, UC-AWDU will fight concretely with student workers for a living wage indexed to the rental market, not the price of milk. 

### Cops Off Campus

The labor movement has a pivotal part to play in the growing rebellion against policing across the country. The way that “police unions” protect killer cop after killer cop makes this plain enough. Cops may have worker associations, but they are not our fellow workers. They are structurally incapable of solidarity because their purpose is to crush dissent, break strikes, and protect the racist status quo. UC-AWDU has a strategy to advance the struggle to get cops off our campus and out of our labor movement.

This is a fight that is already at our doorstep as student workers. The UC has nearly doubled its baseline police budget in the last decade alone. It forecasts an expanded police budget for 2020-21, even as it imposes austerity cuts everywhere else and classes move online. These are funds that could have been spent on instruction for students and wages for workers instead, but UC chooses to arm its private militia instead. This is because spending money on cops reduces insurance premiums and secures lower borrowing rates for the UC, hence UCSC administrators flaunting the $300,000 daily price tag for policing the month-long picket. The UC pays cops and hikes tuition to borrow more money for non-instructional capital ventures, such as its many captive insurance companies.

UCPD also serves administrators by beating, arresting, and racially surveilling strikers and protestors. Cops that receive salaries from their universities are no different from the cops patrolling the streets of US cities — they even work together in what they call a “mutual aid” network. This is why the California Highway Patrol and the Alameda County Sheriff's Office were on the Santa Cruz picket, and why UCPD were on the streets of Oakland to repress Black Lives Matter protests. It’s also why UCLA let LAPD detain protestors at the Jackie Robinson stadium.

UC-AWDU supports and actively participates in the NO COP UNIONS movement, which calls on the AFL-CIO to expel the International Union of Police Associations, and calls on AFL-CIO affiliates (including AFSCME) to terminate their relationships with unionized police and correctional officers. UAW is a part of AFL-CIO, and AFSCME represents thousands of UC workers. This is a major step towards removing the immunity cops enjoy for murdering and brutalizing community members.

The existence of a large, militarized, racist, and highly paid police force is a priority of UC management, clearly stated in its budget. The UCPD is a critical feature of the UC austerity model, and it surveils and demeans students, workers, and the broader public throughout the state. The struggle to kick cops off our campus is at once a struggle to kick them out of the labor movement, and therefore a struggle for justice. The rank and file of UAW 2865 must play its part in this struggle.
