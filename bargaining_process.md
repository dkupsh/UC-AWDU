title: Bargaining Process
---
__Hard Bargaining:__ Fighting for a strong first contract, not just any contract, means refusing to abandon the substantive interests of undergraduate and graduate workers for meager concessions. We are prepared to reject a hasty contract that compromises on our core needs and will instead push for a robust contract that sets a solid precedent for future negotiations with UC.

__Fully Open Bargaining:__ [No secret negotiations!](https://www.labornotes.org/2016/02/seven-steps-opening-bargaining) No sidebars! Every bargaining session will be open to all members of the unit. Bargaining team members will be required to liaise and cooperate with working groups, departmental organizers, affinity organizations, and student governance groups (e.g., GSA) in an organized and strategic fashion to ensure that our members, as well as those non-union groups who represent our members, have a concrete say in every aspect of our contract.

__Expand the Bargaining Team:__ The bargaining team membership should be reflective of the entire membership. A 20-person bargaining team can’t represent the interests of 20,000 workers. We believe in a large rank-and-file bargaining teams, that seek to represent all academic student workers. 

__No Sidebars:__ We reject sidebars, i.e. closed meetings between members of the bargaining team, UAW staff, and UC negotiators. Sidebars have been used in the past to intimidate and divide bargaining teams and push through concessions favorable to management. This is antithetical to negotiating a strong first contract for academic workers.

__Open Sessions with Mediators:__ The employer often brings in third-party mediators towards the end of negotiations to overcome bargaining stalemates in closed sessions. Towards the end of NYU and Columbia academic workers’ negotiations with their administration, a mediator was brought in to rush negotiations in a number of closed sessions, leading to several concessions favorable to management. In the interests of both negotiating a strong first contract and transparency, we, therefore, reject all closed meetings with mediators and support mediation only if it occurs within an open session, in which every effort has been made to include student workers.

__Open Caucusing:__ All unit members are free to observe any caucuses held between the bargaining team, UAW staff, and working groups during a bargaining session. In addition, UAW members who are present during negotiations will be able to follow a clear procedure to call for and participate in an open caucus with the bargaining team during a bargaining session.

__Unit-Wide Votes on Concessions:__ Bargaining demand concessions should be approved by the whole membership, not the few members of the bargaining team. Unit-wide votes on bargaining concessions would require bargaining team members to convince statewide membership, giving members more power during the process and eliciting greater participation.

__Liaising with Working Groups:__ Before entering negotiations on an issue (e.g. sexual harassment and assault, health care, child care), the bargaining team will be required to meet with the working groups whose purview includes that issue. During an open caucus, the bargaining team is also required to include delegates from the relevant working groups in its discussions about proposals, counterproposals, strategy, etc. which might advance the interests of the members of the particular working groups in question at the negotiating table.

__No Lead Negotiator:__ Per the traditional model of union bargaining, a lead negotiator on the bargaining team squares off with the lead negotiator of management’s negotiating team. In contrast to this approach, we support a model where speaking privileges are rotated and shared among all members of the UAW bargaining team to ensure fair representation of our unit at the negotiating table.

__Building Unit Cohesion:__ Developing a rank and file union means encouraging the participation of regular members at all levels of the union. We support an organizing strategy that encourages members’ attendance at bargaining sessions and keeps members well-informed about what’s going on both within the union and at the negotiating table. We will build our cohesion as a union through in-person conversations, regular and transparent communications, issue-based working groups, and a supportive, empathetic union culture.

__No Summer Bargaining:__ We recognize that a significant number of our members will not be present over the summer and that we will most likely experience low union engagement during this time period. In the spirit of open bargaining and democratic participation, we support selecting bargaining sessions that will not occur during the summer.
